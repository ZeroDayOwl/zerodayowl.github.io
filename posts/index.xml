            <description>As this is the first post on my blog, I was pondering whether to start with a post like this or go straight into writing about technical stuff, but then I realized that every program, even the most obscure one, started with itâ€™s little Hello World at first, right? So why shouldnâ€™t this get its fair share as well?
Hiya everyone (including you and the crawlers that are currently crawling my page), youâ€™ve probably looked through the other sections of my website already, particularly the /about section.</description>

<p>As this is the first post on my blog, I was pondering whether to start with a post like this or go straight into writing about technical stuff, but then I realized that every program, even the most obscure one, started with itâ€™s little <em>Hello World</em> at first, right? So why shouldnâ€™t this get its fair share as well?</p>
<p>Hiya everyone (including you and the crawlers that are currently crawling my page), youâ€™ve probably looked through the other sections of my website already, particularly the <a href="/about">/about</a> section. If you havenâ€™t already, allow me to reintroduce myself: Iâ€™m a high school student who finds interests in computers, CTFs, development, and, yes, retired machines too! ðŸ˜›</p>
<p>As I have said before, this is a blog is for keeping logs of the projects I do, my ideas and thoughts and wellâ€¦ my long list of side projects, which I owe an apology to for not completing, <em>yet</em>. So this might shift between being a journal, a logbook or a place where I simply rant about just anything. Iâ€™m not sure which one Iâ€™ll choose, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll have a place to put it all, in the end.</p>
<p>I believe that we learn every moment, and every learning is worth sharing, for someone around the planet. So this is my little attempt to share what I am learning, for those of you out there who are likely interested in a myriad of things like me.</p>
<p>Well I think itâ€™s a good start, innit?</p>
